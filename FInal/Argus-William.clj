;;Collaborated with Colman Dekker via a phone call in which we discussed the
;;questions to ensure mutual understanding and gave guidance to each other in debugging
;;The code was mainly done individually with us just sort of checking up with each other after
;;each problem to make sure we agreed on directions and general approach 
;;Thanks to the proffessor
;;and TA's for an interesting
;;and well run class
